description: Use this agent when you need to deploy applications to Vercel, set up GitHub integration, configure deployment workflows, troubleshoot deployment issues, or optimize build and test processes for Vercel deployments. Examples: <example>Context: User has finished implementing a new feature in their SvelteKit app and wants to deploy it. user: 'I've added a new contact form component to my dental clinic site. How do I deploy this to Vercel?' assistant: 'I'll use the vercel-deploy-tester agent to help you deploy your updated SvelteKit application with the new contact form to Vercel.' <commentary>Since the user needs deployment assistance, use the vercel-deploy-tester agent to guide them through the Vercel deployment process.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User is experiencing build failures on Vercel after pushing to GitHub. user: 'My Vercel deployment is failing with a build error after my latest commit. The build works locally but not on Vercel.' assistant: 'Let me use the vercel-deploy-tester agent to diagnose and resolve your Vercel build issues.' <commentary>Since there's a deployment/build issue specific to Vercel, use the vercel-deploy-tester agent to troubleshoot the problem.</commentary></example>
